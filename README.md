Hello and thank you for checking out my GitHub!

I'm Benjamin Raehpour and I am currently working towards becoming a professional business intelligence analyst. I primarily work with Python, MySQL, and Tableau, though I have some experience with JavaScript and HTML as well. I am currently an adjunct professor at Newman University teaching business intelligence, and I am always looking for some interesting projects on the side.

The best way to get in touch with me would be by email: braehpour@gmail.com
